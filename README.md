# bloch_sphere_visualization
This project is a Bloch Sphere Visualizer built using Python, Tkinter for the GUI, and Qiskit for quantum computing functionality. The visualizer provides an interactive way to visualize quantum states on the Bloch Sphere, which is essential for understanding single-qubit quantum mechanics.

## Features:
- Quantum State Visualization: Visualize the state of a qubit on the Bloch Sphere.
- Interactive GUI: Control the quantum state using Tkinter-based sliders and buttons.
- Qiskit Integration: Utilizes Qiskit to simulate and display quantum states.

## Major Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Qiskit
- Tkinter (pre-installed with Python)

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bloch_sphere_visualization.git

  
  cd sales-data-analytics

2. Install Qiskit1.x from IBM Quantum:

  pip install qiskit

## Usage:
Run the script to launch the Bloch Sphere Visualizer:
  python main.py

Use the GUI to manipulate quantum states and observe the corresponding Bloch Sphere representation.
